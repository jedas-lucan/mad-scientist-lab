            Elina&#39;s Childhood<br />Scene 1: Elementary School, USA<br />Elina sits at her desk reading a science
            book. The camera zooms out, showing kids running around noisily behind her. Paper trash flies around and
            hits Elina&#39;s book, knocking it out of her hands. A group of kids wrestles, and one of them crashes into
            Elina, sending her and her desk flying.<br />Elina’s book lands on the floor, getting trampled and torn by
            the kids.<br />Extra Girl: Hey Elina, your book got ripped! What are you gonna do about it?<br />Extra Boy:
            Here you go, nerd. Take your stupid book back.<br />Elina picks up the book and hits the boy over the head
            with it. She tackles him to the ground and starts punching him.<br />Kids: Ahhh! Teacher! Elina is beating
            up Daniel!<br />Teacher: How dare you hit your friend! Stand outside the classroom and reflect on your
            behavior!<br />Elina goes home looking disheveled.<br />Elina: I’m home.<br />Her younger sibling is playing
            with toys scattered on the living room floor. Her mother is in the kitchen, busy preparing an elaborate meal
            and holding a jelly pudding.<br />Mom: Elina, dinner’s ready.<br />Her father sits at the dining table
            reading a newspaper.<br />Elina: Not jelly again? Why do you put everything in jelly? It&#39;s slimy and
            disgusting.<br />Mom: I thought you liked it.<br />Elina: Haa, mom, I told you I hate this slimy jelly dish
            more than 100 times.<br />Dad: Stop whining. And why do you look like a mess?<br />Elina: I got into a fight
            at school. I was reading about parthenogenesis in lizards when some idiot... they kicked me first and tore
            my book, but I’m the one who got punished. It’s so unfair. School sucks.<br />Mom: Girls shouldn’t fight!
            (Feeding the sibling an airplane bite) What if it leaves a scar? You should handle things gracefully. A lady
            should be gentle. When someone picks on you, you should smile like a princess and...<br />Elina loses her
            appetite.<br />Elina: I’m done eating.<br />She heads to her room.<br />Dad: I don’t know who she takes
            after. She’s so unruly and disrespectful.<br />Elina climbs the stairs to her room, passing family photos on
            the wall.<br />One photo shows her father proudly holding her baby brother like Simba in &#34;The Lion
            King.&#34;<br />Another frame displays their baby footprints and handprints.<br />A Christmas photo shows
            her brother with a toy train and Elina pulling a doll’s hair in front of a dollhouse.<br />In the last
            family photo, Elina scratches her father&#39;s face with her fingernail, tearing it.<br />Elina
            (singing):<br />Born to these idiots, what can I do? In this house, I have no choice at all. Must I realize
            so soon that the world is so unfair? Suffocating in this apathy, There’s no one on my side in this world.
            Words I can&#39;t speak choke me. Isolated, misunderstood, that’s my fate. But I’m not alone, I have Liam.
            (Elina crawls to her desk drawer, opening a secret compartment revealing a snake cage.) My only friend, my
            true family. (Elina takes out the book she was reading at school, taped back together, showing an
            illustration of parthenogenesis in lizards.) Rescued from dad&#39;s disgusting snake liquor stash, My
            beloved sister. I’ll protect you, I swear it. You’re the only one I need, worth more than anything.<br />Elina
            hugs the snake, closing her eyes as the song ends.<br />Scene transitions to teenage Elina, now an emo
            middle schooler, humming a tune as she opens the door with a snake in one hand.<br />Elina: Liam, it&#39;s
            feeding time!<br />She opens the drawer to find it empty.<br />Elina: Liam?<br />Screaming: Ahhhhhhh!!!<br />Mom:
            Snake! Snake! Honey!!!<br />Footsteps rush, followed by a loud bang and a squelch.<br />Close-up of
            Elina&#39;s face, filled with pain and rage.<br />Elina: What have you done?! Liam, no!<br />Dad: I knew
            something was off with that missing liquor bottle years ago. It was you.<br />Elina: You selfish monster!
            All that booze won’t make your limp dick work any better!<br />Dad slaps Elina hard, knocking her down. She
            starts laughing and crying at the same time.<br />Elina: You disgust me. Why did you even have me? I wish
            you all were dead. That rat who took Liam out of my room, you screaming over a harmless snake, and you, dad.
            I pray for your painful, miserable death.<br />Dad: I didn’t expect to raise such an ungrateful brat. You
            need to be disciplined. Enjoy the attic.<br />Elina is dragged and locked in the attic, crying against a
            metal bed frame.<br />Camera pulls out, transitioning from the attic to the outside of the house.<br />Narrator:
            Three years later.<br />Scene: Early morning outside the Kunz house.<br />Elina leaves the house, dragging a
            suitcase and holding a full scholarship acceptance letter from a science high school.<br />Elina: I’ve been
            waiting for this day. But before I leave this hellhole, there&#39;s one last thing to do.<br />Whistling,
            she enters the shed and sets up alcohol lamps, dousing the floor with alcohol. She exits, throwing a sack of
            flour into the shed.<br />The shed explodes behind her as she walks away.<br />Narrator: She left home and
            family with dreams of freedom and a grand future, dedicating herself to her studies. Elina Kunz became a
            scrappy graduate student.<br />Graduate School<br />Scene 2: Inside the lab<br />Graduate students bustle
            about. Elina, carrying a huge load of supplies, navigates through them to the professor&#39;s office. The
            professor is absent, but the TA and her boyfriend are there.<br />Elina: I finished categorizing the data
            you asked for.<br />TA: Great, Kunz. Where’s the data I gave you this morning? I need it by today. Also,
            finish these dishes and organize these numbers into a chart by tomorrow. And prepare a presentation for the
            seminar the day after. Kunz, you’re amazing, so this should be easy, right?<br />Elina: What?! How am I
            supposed to do all this alone? Why am I the only one always swamped with work? What does he even do?!<br />Boyfriend:
            Office husband, haha.<br />Friend passing by: Oh, Kunz has complaints about the lab. Should I tell the
            professor?<br />Professor enters with another TA: Is there a problem, Elina?<br />Elina (blushing and
            glancing at the other grad students): No, Professor. I can handle this… fully enough.<br />Grad students
            snicker.<br />Elina storms out, pushing through the campus doors into the rain.<br />Elina: Damn! What’s
            wrong with today? Why is everything fucked up? Why does the whole world interrupt me? Or is it me that’s
            wrong?<br />She reaches a crosswalk as a car speeds around the corner, splashing water on her.<br />Elina
            (singing):<br />The world doesn’t follow logic. The precise reactions in chemistry only happen in my flask.
            The world is a giant beaker of impurities, and I’m tired. The more I struggle, the thicker the impurities
            block my view. What’s the point of my best efforts? Since grad school started, I haven&#39;t slept well. I
            record tedious experiments, wash mountains of labware, serve lunch and coffee to the professor, and spend
            nights bleeding over research papers. I’ve not done a single line of my own research. I’m out of favor, an
            outcast. No one respects me. I can&#39;t imagine my grand future here. I crave recognition, long for
            inquiry. I’m withering inside. I can’t control my anger, inferiority, madness. I want to scream &#34;Fuck
            you!&#34; I’m tired, I hit the wall. I can’t fight for this shit anymore.<br />An umbrella is held over
            Elina.<br />Voice: Are you crying?<br />Elina: It’s just rain.<br />Voice: Bless you! Seems like you have a
            tough situation. Can I make a proposal?<br />Research Institute<br />Scene 3: Outside the graduate school
            building<br />A crow caws as the door slams open, and someone laughs maniacally.<br />Elina: Elina Kunz,
            dropping out of graduate school.<br />She tosses her papers into the air, dancing joyfully.<br />Elina
            (monologue): I can’t believe such an opportunity came to me! A research institute where I can do my own
            research? No more chores! The pay is seven times more than the grad lab! They provide housing! Goodbye to
            starving days! Finally, good days are coming. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance! Sorry, Professor. You’re
            brilliant, but I can’t take this anymore! I’m done being a lab flunky!<br />Breathless, she kneels on the
            street as a convertible stops in front of her.<br />Yuri: Are you Elina Kunz? What are you doing on the
            ground?<br />Elina: My shoelace came undone.<br />Yuri (tilting his head): You&#39;re wearing loafers.
            Funny. Get in.<br />Elina gets in and fastens her seatbelt.<br />Yuri: I’m Yuri from Klister Research
            Institute, chemistry department.<br />He hands her a strange blindfold.<br />Yuri: Our institute&#39;s
            location is confidential, so you need to wear this blindfold.<br />Elina: (Looking at the odd design) Don’t
            you have something more normal?<br />Yuri: How about this one?<br />He offers a blindfold used for SM
            play.<br />Elina: No, thanks. I’ll wear this one.<br />Elina puts on the blindfold with a reluctant
            expression while Yuri laughs.<br />Yuri: Haha, Kunz, you look like you’re on some kind of trip. Hehe.<br />Elina:
            What’s so funny about that?<br />Yuri: People acting all crazy and saying random things, it’s hilarious,
            isn’t it?<br />Elina: Not at all.<br />Yuri: So stiff! No wonder you have no friends.<br />Elina: ...<br />Yuri:
            ...<br />Yuri (clearing throat): Just joking! No need to worry. There are plenty of weird people at the
            institute. You’ll fit right in.<br />The car drives down a long road lined with palm trees.<br />Elina dozes
            off and wakes up later.<br />Elina: How long has it been? This blindfold messes with my sense of time.<br />She
            adjusts her turtleneck.<br />Elina: Must be the south, it’s warmer.<br />Yuri: You’re awake? We’re almost
            there.<br />The institute comes into view, shaped like a twin-headed serpent with a sleek, futuristic
            design. Elina looks around in awe as they enter the facility.<br />Verse 1:<br />Yuri (singing):Welcome to
            our lair, beneath the city’s glare, Where mystery meets the mind, and secrets we unwind. We’ve waited for so
            long, for someone who belongs, To join this curious throng, every maniac’s been clustered.<br />Chorus:You’re
            the piece we need, a brilliant mind indeed, In our lab of dreams, you’re destined to succeed. Oh, the
            wonders we’ll achieve, the marvels we’ll conceive, In the depths of this lab, we’ll find the lust of
            madness!<br />Verse 2:With every test and trial, our hopes on you compile, A genius so rare, with talent to
            spare. Together we will explore, what no one has before, No need to wonder, we are on the right track of the
            future.<br />In corners of this lore, where shadows dance the floor.<br />Bridge:So raise the flasks, spin
            the gears, In this lab, we face no fears. With every discovery&#39;s cheer, We’re pioneers, with you now
            here!<br />Chorus:You’re the piece we need, a brilliant mind indeed, In our lab of dreams, you’re destined
            to succeed. Oh, the wonders we’ll achieve, the marvels we’ll conceive, In the depths of this lab, we’ll find
            the lust of madness!<br />Outro:Welcome to our fold, where stories will unfold, Mad scientist born tonight,
            in flashes of blue light. In this lab, you&#39;re not just a geek, You&#39;re the future light!<br />The
            institute’s employees welcome Elina as she is shown to her new lab and living quarters.<br />Narrator: Elina
            Kunz, having left her troubled past behind, embraced a new chapter in her life, surrounded by the promise of
            groundbreaking research and boundless opportunities. Little did she know, the true adventure was just
            beginning.
